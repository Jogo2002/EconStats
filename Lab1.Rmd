4. Produce a histogram on the temperature of pizza upon delivery. Is temperature skewed, if so, how?
```{r}
ggplot(INSERT DATA HERE, aes(x = temperature)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  labs(
    x = "Pizza Temp",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Pizza Temperature",
    subtitle = "Binwidth = 10"
  )

```


5. Produce a barplot comparing the average time for delivery by branch location.
6. Create a boxplot to for delivery time comparing the times across the three branches.
